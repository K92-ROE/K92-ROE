<h1> K92 Rules of Engagement </h1>
<h2>General Rules</h2>
<hr>
<div class="pre">
1.    This Kingdom is at peacetime except for the first two days of Clash for the Throne tournament (CoT).
2.    All cities are protected from any attack until they reach 200 000 might.
2.1.    Non-RoE players have no right to ask for compensation in court.
3.    This Kingdom is a place for respect.  Disrespecting players publicly in Kingdom Official Channels is an offense and can be punished by Palace and Royal guards.
4.    Spamming and chatting in the Royal chats will be punished by a ban for players.
5.    Chatting in special resource registration chats (e.g. K92 GOLD) may result in temporary suspension of the right to register.
6.    RoE Clans must remove outlaws within 24 hours or pay their compensation. Failure to do so will result in outlaw status for the clan.
7.    All resource fields including Wellsprings Ruins and Dragon Mounds within a clan's territory (up to a maximum of 5 tiles beyond the clan border in straight line or in diagonal, including the 5th one) belong to that clan.
7.1.    When virtual borders overlap, the first player to occupy owns it.
8.    All system spawned monsters, crypts and arenas are free to be attacked or explored at any time and location. Please do not attack player spawned monsters and Rare crypts opened by other players, as this is really poor behavior. Repeated behavior may result in a fine.
9.    Clan marches at cities, excluding outlaws, are prohibited. In addition to troop and resource losses, compensation of 5M silver is to be paid by each participant of the attack.
10    You may attack hostile portals with reinforcements (clan march). It is illegal to attack other ones.
11.    Scouting is always considered an attack.
12. If you do not want to retaliate, seek compensation.
12.1.    Use the compensation calculator bit.ly/K92_RoE
12.2.    If you are unsure, ask your Superior / Leader / Diplomat to check.
12.3.    Contact the player directly, and politely request compensation. If you receive no satisfactory response, ask your Diplomat to escalate your case.
12.5.    Journal reports are required as evidence. No report = no case.
12.6.    If diplomacy and compensation are not possible, and a retaliation cannot be carried out by the victim, a champion could be requested to carry out a retaliatory attack.
